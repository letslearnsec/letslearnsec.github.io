Computer refers to any electronic device that is capable of processing data, storing it, and displaying information.  

Acording to the definition, then computers are everywhere! That's because the term _computers_ refers to more than just a personal computer or laptop. Smartphones are mini-computers, servers are super-computers, smart TVs, cars, game consoles and refrigerators now have computers built into them. Understanding the basics of these devices and how they work is critical in today's digital world.

Computers have two major components:
1. Hardware
2. Software

In this blog, the focus would be on the hardware components of the computer.

Computer hardware constitutes the physical parts or components of the computer. This includes the keyboard, mouse, random access memory (RAM), monitor, system unit, motherboard and hard disk. With these devices, we can control the computer.

## Computer Hardware Categories
The hardware devices are divided intop the following categories:
1. Input Devices
2. Processing Devices
3. Output Devices
4. Storage Devices

### Input Devices 
These are devices with which the user interacts with the computer. In other words, they are devices used to enter data into the computer being it texts, clicks, sound or documents. These devices collect the data, converts it into computer-understandable format and sends it to the computer for processing.

#### Common input devices
1. **Keybaord**: This is one of the main input devices for computers. The data is inputted by pressing the keys on the keyboard. It has a total of 104 keys which consists of numeric, alphabets, functional and special keys. In it earlier stages, it used a cable for connection but due to the advancement in technology, wireless or bluetooth connection keyboards have been introduced.

2. **Mouse**: This is a pointing device that is used to control the cursor on the monitor. It consists of left, right buttons which are used for the selection of objects and accessing of more options respectively and a scroll wheel which is used to scroll through pages. It also contains a sensor which is used to notify its speed and movement to the computer's cursor.

3. **Microphone**: This is a sound input device that when attached to a computer would convert sound or voice to electrical signals which is then processed by the computer.

4. **Scanner**: This is a device used to convert physical documents, images, or objects into digital format. It captures the information present on a physical medium, such as a piece of paper, photograph, or drawing, and creates a digital representation that can be stored, edited, and shared electronically.

### Processing Devices
Processing devices are essential components of a computer system responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. These devices are used to manipulate or process the data that was inputted into information.

These devices include:
1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The CPU is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer and is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It consist of the Control Unit (CU), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Memory Unit which is also known as the registers.
   - **Control Unit (CU)**: The Control Unit is responsible for coordinating and controlling the operations of the CPU. It interprets instructions fetched from memory, decodes them into a series of signals, and sends out control signals to other components to execute the instructions.  
    - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: The Arithmetic Logic Unit is the part of the CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, and NOT operations. It performs calculations and manipulates data based on the instructions provided by the Control Unit.  
    - **Memory Unit or Registers**: They are small, high-speed storage units located within the CPU. They hold data, instructions, and addresses temporarily during processing. Registers are used by the CPU for fast access to frequently used data and instructions, reducing the need to access slower memory units such as RAM.

1. **Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)**: The GPU is specialized electronic circuit designed to apidly manipulate and render images, videos, and 3D graphics, particularly important for gaming, multimedia, and graphical applications. GPUs have a large number of cores compared to CPUs, allowing them to process multiple tasks simultaneously. This parallel processing capability makes GPUs particularly well-suited for tasks that require massive amounts of calculations.

While a Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a general-purpose processor responsible for executing instructions and handling tasks such as running programs, managing memory, and performing calculations, a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is specifically optimized for rendering graphics and images. It is capable of performing parallel computations necessary for rendering 2D and 3D graphics, image processing, video playback, and other visual tasks.

### Output Devices
Output devices are components of a computer system that display or present the results of processed data to the user in a human-readable form. These devices convert electronic information produced by the computer into a form that humans can understand.

#### Common Output Devices
1. **Monitor**: The monitor which is also known as the **Visual Display Unit (VDU)** is the main output device of the computer. It displays information in the form of text, images and videos.

2. **Printer**: The printer is an output device that produce hard copies of electronic documents by transfering ink or toner onto paper. There are both colored and grayscale (black and white) printers. Printers are commonly used to produce documents, photos, graphics, and other printed materials.

3. **Speakers**: These are output devices used to reproduce audio generated by the computer. They allow users to hear sound effects, music, voice recordings, and other auditory information produced by applications running on the computer.

4. **Projectors**: hey display visual content from a computer onto a large screen or flat surface, typically for presentations, meetings, or entertainment purposes. They can be connected to computers via cables or wirelessly to mirror the computer screen onto a larger display.

### Storage Devices
Storage devices are hardware components used to store and retrieve digital data in a computer system. They provide both short-term and long-term storage solutions for various types of data, including programs, documents, multimedia files, and operating systems. Examples of storage devices include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, memory cards, and optical discs. 

#### Categories of Storage Devices 
1. **Volatile Storage Devices**: These are devices that lose their data when the power is turned off. They rely on electrical charges to hold data temporarily. These types of storage are typically faster but more expensive compared to non-volatile storage.

   - **Random Access Memory (RAM)**: RAM is the most common volatile storage device in computers. It is used to temporarily store data and program instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly during operation. However, RAM loses its data when the computer is turned off or restarted.

   - **Cache Memory**: Cache memory is another type of volatile storage located within the CPU. It temporarily stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing. Like RAM, cache memory loses its contents when power is removed.
  
2. **Non-volatile Storage Devices**: These are devices that retain their data even when the power is turned off. They are used for long-term storage of data and programs, providing a way to store information permanently.
   
    - **Hard Disk Drives (HDD)**: HDDs store data magnetically on spinning disks called platters. They offer high-capacity storage for applications, documents, multimedia files, and operating systems. Data stored on HDDs remains intact even when the computer is powered off.

    - **Solid-State Drives (SSD)**: SSDs use flash memory to store data electronically, offering faster access speeds and improved durability compared to HDDs. They are commonly used as primary storage drives in modern computers and laptops. SSDs retain data even when power is removed.

    - **USB Flash Drives**: USB flash drives, also known as thumb drives or memory sticks, are portable storage devices that use flash memory to store data. They are commonly used for data transfer, backup, and portable storage. Data stored on USB flash drives remains intact even when disconnected from power.

## Other Internal Components
